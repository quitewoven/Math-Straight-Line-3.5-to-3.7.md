# Straight Line – Sections 3.5 to 3.7

## Section 3.5: Slope and Angle
- Slope (m) = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)
- Angle with x-axis:  
  If a line makes angle θ with the x-axis, then  
  `m = tan(θ)`
- Types of slope:
  - Positive: rising line
  - Negative: falling line
  - Zero: horizontal
  - Undefined: vertical

## Section 3.6: Equation of Straight Line
- **Point-slope form**:  
  `y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)`
- **Two-point form**:  
  If points are (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂):  
  `y - y₁ = [(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)](x - x₁)`
- **Slope-intercept form**:  
  `y = mx + c`
- **Intercept form**:  
  `x/a + y/b = 1`

## Section 3.7: General Equation and Conditions
- General form:  
  `Ax + By + C = 0`
- Slope from general form:  
  `m = -A/B`
- Parallel lines:  
  Same slope
- Perpendicular lines:  
  Product of slopes = -1
